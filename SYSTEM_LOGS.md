## Investigation: Pricing Page Not Working
**Date:** 2025-07-23  
**Issue:** User reports pricing page isn't working  
**Investigation Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Log Entry 1: Initial Assessment
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-23 00:05:00  
**Action:** Testing pricing page accessibility  

### Current Status Check:
- URL: http://159.65.224.175/pricing.html
- Expected: Functional pricing page with Stripe integration
- Local File: pricing.html (exists, 27.3KB)

### Test Commands:
```bash
curl -I http://159.65.224.175/pricing.html
```

### Test Results:
**❌ ISSUE CONFIRMED: 404 Not Found**
- Production URL: http://159.65.224.175/pricing.html returns 404
- Server: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
- Response time: 0.097s
- File size: 162 bytes (nginx error page)

**✅ Local file is intact:**
- pricing.html exists locally (27,969 bytes)
- File permissions: 755 (executable)
- Last modified: Jul 22 19:01

**ROOT CAUSE: File not deployed to production server**

---

## File Integrity Check
**Local Files Status:**
- ✅ pricing.html exists locally (27.3KB)
- ✅ Contains Stripe integration code
- ✅ Contains Supabase authentication
- ✅ Navigation links updated to /pricing.html

### Potential Issues to Investigate:
1. File not deployed to production server
2. Server routing/htaccess issues
3. File permissions on server
4. JavaScript/integration errors
5. Network/DNS issues

---

## Next Steps:
1. Test production accessibility
2. Check local file functionality
3. Verify Stripe/Supabase integrations
4. Test user flow from navigation
5. Validate all interactive elements

**Status:** ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

## Log Entry 2: Production Server Analysis
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-23 00:10:00  
**Action:** Testing what files exist on production server

### Production Server Status:
- ✅ Root URL (/) works: Returns HTML content
- ✅ login-real.html works: HTTP 200, 15.4KB
- ❌ signup.html: HTTP 404 Not Found
- ❌ pricing.html: HTTP 404 Not Found

### Pattern Identified:
- Some files deployed (index, login-real.html)
- Missing key revenue pages (signup.html, pricing.html, billing.html)
- These are the same files identified in previous 404 fix analysis

### Deployment Gap Confirmed:
The pricing page isn't working because it's not deployed to production along with signup.html and billing.html.

## Log Entry 3: Local File Validation
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-23 00:15:00  
**Action:** Testing local pricing.html functionality

### Local File Analysis:
- ✅ File structure: Valid HTML5 document
- ✅ Stripe integration: 5 instances of stripe code
- ✅ Supabase integration: 6 instances of supabase code
- ✅ File size: 27.3KB (substantial functionality)
- ✅ Permissions: 755 (readable/executable)

### Integration Check:
```html
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js"></script>
```

### Conclusion:
Local pricing.html is fully functional and ready for deployment.

## Log Entry 6: Playwright Navigation Analysis  
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-23 00:30:00  
**Action:** Testing production navigation menu URLs with Playwright MCP

### Playwright Test Results:
**URL Tested:** http://159.65.224.175/

### Navigation Issues Found:
- ❌ **Login Link**: `/login` → 404 (should be `/login-real.html`)
- ❌ **Signup Link**: `/signup` → 404 (should be `/signup.html`) 
- ❌ **Demo Links**: `/demo` → 404 (should be `/editor.html`)
- ⚠️ **Pricing**: `#pricing` → anchor link but no pricing section exists
- ⚠️ **Dashboard**: `#` → empty link (should be `/dashboard.html`)

### Working Links:
- ✅ **Homepage**: `/` → 200 OK
- ✅ **Features**: `#features` → anchor link works
- ✅ **Available Files**: `/login-real.html`, `/editor.html`, `/dashboard.html` exist

### Root Cause:
**Production server has old index.html** with incorrect navigation URLs that don't match the current file structure.

### Impact:
- 44.4% of navigation links are broken (4 out of 9)
- Users cannot access login, signup, or demo functionality
- Navigation points to non-existent routes
