## üîß Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. FTP-Monaco Integration
**Problem:** Method name mismatches causing "Failed to send a request to the Edge Function" errors
**Solution:** 
- Updated `monaco-editor.js` to use correct method names
- Aligned all method calls with FTP service API
- Fixed data access patterns

### 2. Netlify Deployment Compatibility
**Problem:** PHP FTP handler can't execute on Netlify's static hosting
**Solution:**
- Created Node.js serverless function replacement
- Added proper redirects in `netlify.toml`
- Included required dependencies

### 3. Documentation Gaps
**Problem:** Lack of comprehensive documentation for development and deployment
**Solution:**
- Created complete technical documentation suite
- Added project-specific AI context
- Included testing strategies and deployment guides

## üìä Test Results
All integration tests passing:
- ‚úÖ File structure validation
- ‚úÖ Method name consistency
- ‚úÖ Netlify configuration
- ‚úÖ Function dependencies
- ‚úÖ Monaco editor setup
