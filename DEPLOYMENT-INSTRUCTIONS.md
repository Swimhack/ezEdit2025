## 🔧 Deployment Options

2. Upload the 5 files above to the web root directory
3. Set file permissions to 644

### Option 2: Manual Copy (if you have server access)

# Copy files to web root
cp signup.html /var/www/html/
cp pricing.html /var/www/html/
cp billing.html /var/www/html/
cp checkout-demo.html /var/www/html/
cp index.html /var/www/html/

# Set proper permissions
chmod 644 /var/www/html/*.html
```

### Option 3: Git Pull (if git is configured on server)
```bash
ssh root@159.65.224.175 'cd /var/www/html && git pull origin feat/ftp-mvp'
```

## 🧪 Validation Commands

```bash
curl -I http://159.65.224.175/signup.html
curl -I http://159.65.224.175/pricing.html
