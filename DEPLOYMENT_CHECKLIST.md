## Deployment Steps

### 1. Netlify Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in Netlify dashboard:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://natjhcqynqziccsnwim.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[from Supabase dashboard]

# AI Service Keys
CLAUDE_API_KEY=[from Anthropic]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[from OpenAI]

# Encryption Key (generate new)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=[generate with: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"]

# Stripe Keys (if using payments)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[from Stripe]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[from Stripe]
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
```bash
# Option 1: Git deployment (recommended)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Fix FTP-Monaco integration and add serverless functions"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Manual deployment
netlify deploy --prod --dir=public
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
After deployment, test these endpoints:

#### FTP Function Test
```bash
# Test FTP function is accessible
curl -X POST https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/ftp-handler \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "connect", "host": "test.rebex.net", "username": "demo", "password": "password"}'
```

#### Static Assets Test
```bash
# Test static files are served
curl -I https://your-site.netlify.app/js/monaco-editor.js
curl -I https://your-site.netlify.app/js/ftp-service.js
```

### 4. Function Logs Monitoring
Monitor function logs for any issues:
```bash
netlify functions:log ftp-handler
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found after deployment:

### 1. Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous deployment
netlify sites:list
netlify api rollbackSiteDeploy --data '{"site_id": "your-site-id"}'
```

### 2. Debug Function Issues
```bash
# Check function logs
netlify functions:log ftp-handler --live

# Test function locally
netlify dev
```

### 3. Emergency Fixes
For critical issues, apply hotfixes:
```bash
# Fix critical issue
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
# Make minimal changes
git commit -m "hotfix: Fix critical issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-fix
# Deploy immediately
netlify deploy --prod --dir=public
```

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] FTP connection works end-to-end
- [ ] Monaco editor loads and functions correctly
- [ ] File open/edit/save workflow completes
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] Error handling is user-friendly

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- User registration/login success rate
- FTP connection success rate
- File operation success rate
- Monaco editor load time
- Function execution time
- Error rates

### Alerting Setup
Set up alerts for:
- Function errors > 5%
- Response times > 5 seconds
- High error rates
- User complaints

## Documentation Updates

After successful deployment:
- [ ] Update README.md with deployment status
- [ ] Document any configuration changes
- [ ] Update API documentation if needed
- [ ] Create user guide for new features

## Notes

### Key Improvements Made
1. **Fixed Method Mismatches**: Aligned Monaco editor calls with FTP service methods
2. **Added Serverless Function**: Replaced PHP FTP handler with Node.js function for Netlify
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better data access patterns and error messages
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for development and deployment
5. **Added Testing**: Integration tests to catch regressions

### Known Limitations
- Connection pooling uses in-memory storage (consider Redis for production scale)
- File upload size limited by Netlify function timeout (10 minutes)
- No real-time collaboration features (planned for future)

### Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment for 48 hours
2. Gather user feedback
3. Plan next iteration based on usage data
4. Implement advanced features (Git integration, team collaboration)
