# ezEdit - Full-Stack PHP Web/FTP Editor

ezEdit is an AI-powered web/FTP editor that allows non-technical users to open legacy sites over FTP, live-edit code with a Monaco-style split editor, preview changes instantly, and save to the server.

## Project Structure

The application follows an MVC architecture with the following structure:

Let me examine the specific errors from the logs and console to understand what's happening with the file browsing issue.

Now let me check the specific error patterns from the console logs more closely. Looking at the console logs you provided, I can see several key error patterns:

Primary Error Analysis
1. "Failed to send a request to the Edge Function"

This error appears consistently across multiple attempts
The error originates from ftpService.ts in the makeRequest method
Stack trace shows: Error: Failed to send a request to the Edge Function
2. Edge Function Never Receives Requests

The analytics query shows zero activity for the ftp-operations edge function
This confirms the requests are failing at the transport layer before reaching the edge function
3. Active Site Detection Issues

Console shows: "üöÄ Active site detected: StricklandAi.com ID: 7ae8cfc8-8d1e-43e2-a753-109634eac05b"
But then shows: "‚ùå No active site available for file listing"
This suggests a race condition or state management issue
4. Session Management

Multiple session checks are happening: "üìù Session check: { hasSession: true, hasAccessToken: true }"
This indicates authentication is working correctly
5. FTP Ping Failures

"‚ö†Ô∏è FTP Ping: https://caf17cdc-1be4-4e21-af7e-fe24c63f8b7a.supabase.co/functions/v1/ftp-operations failed"
Error: "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
Root Cause Analysis
The core issue is transport layer failure. The errors indicate:

Network-level fetch failures - "Failed to fetch" suggests either:

CORS issues
Network connectivity problems
Incorrect endpoint URLs
Project URL mismatch - The ping URL shows caf17cdc-1be4-4e21-af7e-fe24c63f8b7a.supabase.co but this might not match the actual project configuration

Race conditions - The active site is detected but then reported as unavailable, suggesting timing issues in state management

Specific Error Messages Summary
Primary: "Failed to send a request to the Edge Function"
Secondary: "Failed to fetch" (network level)
State: "No active site available for file listing"
Transport: Zero edge function activity in logs
The issue is fundamentally that no requests are reaching the edge function at all - they're failing at the browser/network level before even getting to Supabase's infrastructure.)
