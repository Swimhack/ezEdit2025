# ezEdit - AI-Powered Web/FTP Editor

ezEdit is a static web application that lets non-technical users open legacy sites over FTP, live-edit code with a Monaco-style split editor, preview changes instantly, and save to the server.

## Project Overview

ezEdit is built as a fully static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application with no build tools, no Node.js dependencies, and no Docker requirements. This makes it extremely easy to deploy to any static hosting service.

### Key Features

- **Secure FTP connector**: Add sites with host, port, user, password, and passive mode settings
- **File Explorer**: Collapsible tree, lazy-load directories, breadcrumb navigation
- **Split code editor**: Monaco diff/merge view with original and edited versions
- **AI assistance**: Chat-assist side panel ("Klein" agent) that can propose patches
- **Preview pane**: Inline iframe refreshing on save
- **Plans & gating**: Free trial (view & preview) and Pro plan (unlimited sites, save & publish)
